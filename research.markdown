I am presently interested in algorithms and architectures for low power video codec circuits. These circuits are typically intended to be used as dedicated hardware accelerators in smartphones and other energy-constrained applications. Previously, I have worked on fast statistical techniques for evaluating SRAM failure due to process variation.

From 2011 - 2012, I was part of the team that designed a video decoder for H.265/HEVC, the latest video coding standard. The team included [Chao-Tsung Huang](http://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/chaotsung/index.html) and [Chiraag Juvekar](http://www.mit.edu/~chiraag) and was guided by Vivienne Sze and Anantha Chandrakasan. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phqEeu7zyq4) a video of our prototype demo system with our chip ("MIT HEVC Decoder" at the start of the video) decoding a 2160p video sequence that is then displayed on four full-HD (1080p) monitors. [Here's](http://player.vimeo.com/video/70360822) a video of me explaining our work at the demo session of the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in Feb. 2013.
