I am presently interested in algorithms and architectures for low power video codec circuits. These circuits are typically intended to be used as dedicated hardware accelerators in smartphones and other energy-constrained applications. Previously, I have worked on fast statistical techniques for evaluating SRAM failure due to process variation.
